    <system:String x:Key="AldousBroder" xml:space="preserve">Aldous-Broder algorithm generates random mazes with no bias. As such, it's considered the average baseline for other algorithms.

Properties:
• around 30% of cells are dead ends,
• around 17% of cells are included in the solution path,
• around 24% of cells require making a decision.  
 </system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="HuntAndKill" xml:space="preserve">Hunt And Kill algorithm produces mazes that feature long, twisting passages. Its solution paths typically contain more cells than the average.
    
Properties:
• around 10% of cells are dead ends,
• around 26% of cells are included in the solution path,
• around 9% of cells require making a decision.
